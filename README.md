### What is Github ?
Github is like google drive . You Can Upload photos ,  videos and files to google drive . But Why we do this .....

1. I Want my Photos to be safe . 
2. When you lost your phone your files are safe with google drive .
3. Multiple Person can access those files and they can also upload files and modify any file .
4. I can Properly Manage my Files .

Ok That's Fine but we are learning about github ......

Github is similar to somethings like this but instead of your photos and videos we upload our Codes to github .

### benefit's of Github 

1. Similar to keep our photos safe we want our code be remain safe for example : when you are working on a project you have completed it 70% Now its time deliver your project but suppose your system got crush or your system got breaks . Then you need to Start from scratch again .

2. Suppose 10 People are working with you and you have wrote some code . Now you want to merge the code then you will manually merge all code one by one that's very wired process . so we use github .

3. Code is secured and safe . 
4. YOu project can be connect to another software like google cloud , Azure , AWS etc .


That's fine we know about many thing about github lets know some terms of github .

### What is a repository ?
Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updations and modifications in the content of the file. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to create these versions and store them in a specific place termed a repository. The process of copying the content from an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed cloning. Once the cloning process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by default assumes the work to be done on the repository is as a user, once the cloning is done. Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. To delete a repository, the simpler way is to just delete the folder containing the repository.

### What is a Branch ?

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.

### What is git ?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

That's All Basic About Git 

## Basic Command 
Before we get start you need to setup git download if not . 
let's get started .
 1. Learn About the following commands .
 
    a. git add file_path && git add . ( diffrent between both )

    b. git commit -m "msg" ( Learn in deep )

    c. git remote -v

    e. git init 

    f. git push origin branch_name

    g. git pull origin branch_name 

    h. git status 

    i. git diff 

    j. git log 

2. Advance , You can learn this things in advance 

    a. git commit --amend 

    b. rebase

    c. git merge 

    d. git merge --abort 

    e. git merge --continue

    f. revert 

    g. how to create PR ( pull requests)

    h. how to rebase branch 

    i. working with multiple branch 

    j. revert chnages after commiting 

    k. delete a branch 

    l. keep learning 

    m. stash

    n. config

    o. restore

    P. authentication using ssh , token and username password

    r. checkout
 
    s. cherry-pick



# Time Management 

For Learning about theory you Will Have 1 Day . But Why you should read theory  because its help you to create interviews .

1 Day For Learning About Github , Branches , Repo Etc 

2 Days To Practice Basic Command 

2 Day's To learn advance command 

You Just Need 5 Days to learn git 


# Scenarios
* You are collaborating with another developer on a project, and both of you have made conflicting changes to the same file. Your task is to resolve the merge conflict and ensure the final code incorporates both sets of changes seamlessly.

* You have made a commit that introduced a bug or unwanted changes to the project. Your task is to revert the specific commit and roll back the code to the state before that commit was made.

* Your project includes submodules that are separate Git repositories. Your task is to add a new submodule, update an existing submodule to a specific commit, or remove a submodule from the project.

* You are working on a large project with a team, following a collaborative branching model like Gitflow. Your task is to create feature branches, hotfix branches, and release branches as per the established workflow, ensuring smooth collaboration and integration of code changes.

* You want to automate certain actions or enforce specific checks whenever certain Git events occur, such as pre-commit or post-receive. Your task is to set up and configure Git hooks to trigger custom scripts or perform validations during these events.
