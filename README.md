### What is Github ?
Github is like google drive . You Can Upload photos ,  videos and files to google drive . But Why we do this .....

1. I Want my Photos to be safe . 
2. When you lost your phone your files are safe with google drive .
3. Multiple Person can access those files and they can also upload files and modify any file .
4. I can Properly Manage my Files .

Ok That's Fine but we are learning about github ......

Github is similar to somethings like this but instead of your photos and videos we upload our Codes to github .

### benefit's of Github 

1. Similar to keep our photos safe we want our code be remain safe for example : when you are working on a project you have completed it 70% Now its time deliver your project but suppose your system got crush or your system got breaks . Then you need to Start from scratch again .

2. Suppose 10 People are working with you and you have wrote some code . Now you want to merge the code then you will manually merge all code one by one that's very wired process . so we use github .

3. Code is secured and safe . 
4. YOu project can be connect to another software like google cloud , Azure , AWS etc .


That's fine we know about many thing about github lets know some terms of github .

### What is a repository ?
Repositories in GIT contain a collection of files of various different versions of a Project. These files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updations and modifications in the content of the file. A VCS or the Version Control System is used to create these versions and store them in a specific place termed a repository. The process of copying the content from an existing Git Repository with the help of various Git Tools is termed cloning. Once the cloning process is done, the user gets the complete repository on his local machine. Git by default assumes the work to be done on the repository is as a user, once the cloning is done. Users can also create a new repository or delete an existing repository. To delete a repository, the simpler way is to just delete the folder containing the repository.

### What is a Branch ?

Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.

### What is git ?
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
